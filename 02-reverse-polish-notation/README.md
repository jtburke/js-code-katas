# Reverse Polish Notation

The input for the function should be a space separated string.

## End Goal Test
`1` `2` `+` `4` `*` `5` `+` `3` `-` = `14`  
`5` `1` `2` `+` `4` `*` `+` `3` `âˆ’` = `14`

However feel free to take it as far as you like.

## Baby step rules
1. Start a timer (3 minutes suggested but whatever you're comfortable with)
2. Write exactly 1 test
    * If the timer ends and the test is red then `git reset --hard`
    * If the test is green then `git commit -a -m "refactor {feature}"`
4. Restart timer
5. Refactor
    * If the timer ends and refactoring is not complete then `git reset --hard`
    * If the refactoring is complete before the timer ends `git commit -a -m "refactor {feature}"`
6. Goto 1 `goto statements ftw`
