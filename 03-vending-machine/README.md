# Vending Machine
Implement a magical vending machine.

## Rules
- **No** static calls to methods  
- **No** real implementations in unit tests  
  **Other than the class youâ€™re testing/data classes you're asserting against**  
- **Do not** change files with ```// DO NOT MODIFY``` on first line  
- **Do not** change signature of:  
  MagicVendingMachine.insert(...)  
  MagicVendingMachine.requestProduct(...)  
  MagicVendingMachine.requestChange(...)  

## End goal
Get all tests in ```test/acceptance/acceptance-test.js``` to pass.

Change ```it.skip(...``` to ```it(...``` to un-ignore a test. http://mochajs.org/#inclusive-tests

However feel free to take it as far as you like.
